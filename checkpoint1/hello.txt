Hello! My name is Chloe Zeien. I'm a sophomore studying data science in LSA (still undecided but that is the plan). A fun fact about me is that I'm not a big movie person at all but I do love the movie Trolls and can sing every song word for word (the soundtrack is so good)! I'm also very excited for MDST :)
